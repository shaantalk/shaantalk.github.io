# Intro

Welcome to my tech playground, where lines of code dance to create enchanting experiences! I'm a Software Engineer stationed in Bangalore, channeling my frontend prowess to redefine digital landscapes at Cisco.

Fueling my journey is a solid foundation from Techno India College Of Technology (Kolkata), where I earned my stripes in Computer Science with a stellar Bachelor of Technology degree. Graduating in 2018 with a Grade of 8.13, I've been on a relentless quest to marry my academic wisdom with real-world innovation.

Fast forward to the present, and you'll find me at Cisco, infusing life into the Secure Workload platform. Real-time telemetry data? Check. Reporting dashboards that are as sleek as they are informative? Double-check. And did I mention the ongoing magic of integrating Kenna for security that's not just robust but visually spectacular?

But that's not all! My stint at CSG (Citrix) was like curating a digital art gallery. Leading frontend development for the Service Graph product, I turned interfaces into visual masterpieces that users won't forget.

Lowe's witnessed my transformative touch, where I transformed wireframes into dynamic UI, conjuring up tools like the Metrics Dashboard and Asset Inventory Search. Because, let's be honest, analytics should be as visually appealing as your favorite Instagram filter, right?

Starting as an Associate Software Engineer, I translated design dreams into interactive reality using HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Python's Django magic. My tech toolkit includes React.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, and a sprinkle of Amazon Web Services (AWS), Highcharts, Cytoscape â€“ a virtual arsenal of frontend awesomeness.

So, whether I'm crafting code or sharing the secrets of JavaScript and React on YouTube, I invite you to join me on this rollercoaster ride where frontend skills meet academic wisdom and innovation. Let's paint the digital canvas with strokes of brilliance together! ðŸš€âœ¨
