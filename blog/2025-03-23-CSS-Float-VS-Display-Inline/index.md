# Float vs Display Inline in CSS

## Overview
Understanding the differences between `float`, `display: inline`, and `display: inline-block` is essential for structuring layouts in CSS. This article explains the key differences and behaviors of these properties.

## Key Differences

### 1. **Display Inline vs Inline-Block**
- `display: inline`: Treats elements like words in a sentence, meaning they are placed next to each other with spaces in between.
  - **Limitations:** Does not respect `width` and `height` properties.
- `display: inline-block`: Similar to `inline`, but allows `width` and `height` to be applied.
  - **Issue:** Older browsers (IE6/7) only apply `inline-block` to naturally inline elements like `<span>` and `<a>`.
  - **Fix:** Use `display: inline; zoom: 1;` for compatibility.

### 2. **Float Left vs Display Inline-Block**
- `float: left`: Moves elements to the left and allows wrapping of adjacent content.
  - Works on older browsers like **IE6/7**.
  - Elements may stack when the viewport is too small.
- `display: inline-block`: Keeps elements in a row but does not float them.
  - May cause spacing issues due to inline rendering.
  - Does not work properly in IE6/7 for block elements.

### 3. **Float vs Display Table-Cell**
- `float: left` and `display: inline-block` both cause stacking when the viewport is too small.
- `display: table-cell`: Ensures elements remain in a row, even when the viewport shrinks, by reducing their width.

## Conclusion
Choosing between `float`, `inline`, `inline-block`, and `table-cell` depends on your layout needs and browser support requirements. For modern layouts, `flexbox` and `grid` are preferred over floats and inline-block techniques.
